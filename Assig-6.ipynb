    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the term \"self\" is commonly used to represent the instance of the class. It is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class. \"Self\" allows the instance to refer to its own attributes and methods within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why \"self\" is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Identifying Instance Variables: \"Self\" helps in differentiating between the instance variables and local variables. It allows you to access the instance variables that are associated with a particular instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Accessing Instance Methods: With \"self,\" you can call other methods within the class. It helps in accessing and invoking other methods that are defined within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Differentiating Between Class and Instance Variables: \"Self\" is essential in distinguishing between class variables and instance variables. It helps in accessing instance variables that are specific to an object rather than the class as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Maintaining Encapsulation: \"Self\" plays a vital role in encapsulation, as it enables controlled access to the instance's attributes and methods. It ensures that the internal state of the object is accessible and modifiable only through well-defined methods."
