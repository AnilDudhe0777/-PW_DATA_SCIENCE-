    "Multithreading: While multithreading may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores, it can be more efficient for I/O-bound tasks or operations that \n",
    "involve waiting for external resources, due to the lower overhead associated with thread creation and management.\n",
    "Data Sharing and Communication:\n",
