    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. \n",

    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes. \n",
    "Specifically, the result of the execution is dependent on the order in which the threads are scheduled to run. Race conditions can lead to \n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a brief comparison between deadlocks and race conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cause: Deadlocks are caused by circular dependencies between two or more threads waiting for each other to release resources. Race conditions, \n",
    "on the other hand, occur due to the non-deterministic and unpredictable order of execution of threads, leading to unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Deadlocks result in a complete halt of the program, leading to unresponsiveness. Race conditions can lead to inconsistent data or erroneous \n",
    "outcomes that may be difficult to reproduce and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevention: Deadlocks can be prevented by ensuring that resources are allocated in a way that prevents circular waiting. Race conditions can be \n",
